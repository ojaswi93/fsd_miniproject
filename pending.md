### 1. **Social Media Logins (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn)**
   - In addition to Google Sign-Up, you can integrate other social media logins like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. 
   - This can be done using similar OAuth2.0 authentication strategies, making it easier for users to sign up or log in using their social media accounts.
   
   **Libraries/Tools:**
   - `passport-facebook` for Facebook
   - `passport-twitter` for Twitter
   - `passport-linkedin` for LinkedIn

### 2. **Email Verification and Password Recovery**
   - Implement email verification during registration to ensure that users are providing valid email addresses.
   - Add functionality for users to reset their passwords via email in case they forget their credentials.

   **Libraries/Tools:**
   - `nodemailer` for sending emails (for email verification and password recovery).
   - Implement token-based systems for password reset and email verification.

### 3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   - Implement an extra layer of security by requiring users to enter a code sent to their email or phone (via SMS) when they log in.
   - This can be particularly useful for protecting sensitive user information.

   **Libraries/Tools:**
   - `speakeasy` (for generating OTPs)
   - `qrcode` (for generating QR codes for 2FA setup)
   - Use third-party APIs like **Twilio** for SMS-based 2FA.

### 4. **Real-Time Chat/Messaging System**
   - Add a messaging feature so employers and workers can communicate directly within the platform.
   - This could be real-time chat using WebSockets or integration with a service like **Twilio**.

   **Libraries/Tools:**
   - `socket.io` for real-time messaging.
   - You can build a chat interface where users can send messages and receive real-time notifications.

### 5. **Job Alerts and Notifications**
   - Implement job alerts to notify workers about new job postings that match their profile, location, or preferences.
   - Integrate push notifications or email notifications to keep users updated.

   **Libraries/Tools:**
   - `node-cron` for scheduling job alerts.
   - Use **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** or **Twilio** for push notifications or email alerts.
