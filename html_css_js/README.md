# WorksApp - A Platform for Unskilled Labor Employment

## Problem Statement

Unemployment among unskilled laborers in India is a significant issue. Many individuals without educational qualifications struggle to find consistent and reliable employment, particularly in an economy where job opportunities are often linked to formal education. This results in a lack of income stability and financial insecurity for a substantial portion of the workforce.

## Proposed Solution

To address this issue, WorksApp will be developed, a specialized platform similar to LinkedIn but tailored specifically for individuals lacking educational qualifications. This website will serve two main functions:

1. **Connecting Startups with Short-term Labor**:

   - **Medium for Employment**: The platform will enable startups to find unskilled labor for short-term tasks that do not require formal education. For example, startups may need workers for temporary jobs like stapling papers or assisting in cooking for a few days. This allows businesses to hire the necessary workforce for specific periods without the need for long-term commitments.

2. **Providing Income Opportunities for Daily Wage Workers**:
   - **Platform for Job Access**: The website will offer daily wage workers a means to find and access short-term job opportunities. This is particularly beneficial for those who rely on daily earnings, providing them with a stable source of income by connecting them to available jobs in their area.

By bridging the gap between startups in need of temporary help and unskilled laborers seeking employment, this website aims to reduce unemployment and provide financial stability for daily wage workers.
