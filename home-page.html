        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>
          WorksApp is dedicated to empowering unskilled laborers by connecting
          them with short-term job opportunities that match their skills and
          availability. Our platform bridges the gap between workers and
          businesses in need of temporary help, making the job search process
          simple and accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Connecting Startups with Short-term Labor: The platform will act as a
          medium for startups to find unskilled labor for short-term tasks that
          do not require formal education.
        </p>
        <p>
          Providing Income Opportunities for Daily Wage Workers: The website
          will offer a means of income for individuals who depend on daily
          wages. By providing a platform where these workers can find and access
          short-term job opportunities, the website will help improve their
          livelihood. This is particularly beneficial for those whose earnings
          are inconsistent and rely heavily on daily job availability.
